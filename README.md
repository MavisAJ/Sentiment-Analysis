The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model to assess if a Twitter post related to vaccinations is 
positive, neutral, or negative. This solution could help governments and other public health actors monitor public sentiment towards COVID-19 vaccinations
and help improve public health policy, vaccine communication strategies, and vaccination programs across the world.
Two pretrained models were finetuned i.e a distilled bert model and a roberta model. With the use of the roberta model a gradio app was created deployed 
on huggingface.

Here is the link to the deployed app

The train dataset(hugging.csv) and the test dataset, the models and app files are all attached to this repo.
