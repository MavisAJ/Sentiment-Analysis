The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model to assess if a Twitter post related to vaccinations is 
positive, neutral, or negative. This solution could help governments and other public health actors monitor public sentiment towards COVID-19 vaccinations
and help improve public health policy, vaccine communication strategies, and vaccination programs across the world.
Two pretrained models were finetuned i.e a distilled bert model and a roberta model. With the use of the roberta model a gradio app was created deployed 
on huggingface.
The train dataset(hugging.csv) and the test dataset, the models and app which where built on colab are all attached to the repo.
